# Google Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
Predicting securities market costs may be a complicated task that historically involves intensive  human-computer interaction. Due to the related nature of stock costs, typical batch process strategies cannot be used with eï¬ƒciency for stock market analysis. we tend to propose AN on-line learning rule that utilizes a kind of repeated neural network (RNN) referred to as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), wherever the weights are adjusted for individual information points mistreatment random gradient descent. This can offer additional correct results once compared to existing stock worth prediction algorithms. The network is trained and evaluated for accuracy with varied sizes of information, and the results are tabulated. A comparison with respect to accuracy is then performed against a man-made Neural Network.
